    "## Geth\n",
    "\n",
    "`geth` is the entry point into the Ethereum network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default) archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Public Network**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the real PoW Ethereum network, where you use real ether. Use this netowrk only once you are confident of your operations and tested properly your smart contracts on a private or test network.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a full node on the main ehtereum network:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "geth console\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The command will do two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start geth in fast sync mode (default, can be changed with the `--syncmode` flag), causing it to download more data in exchange for avoiding processing the entire history of the Ethereum network, which is very CPU intensive.\n",
    "- Start up Geth's built-in interactive JavaScript console, (via the trailing console subcommand) through which you can invoke all official web3 methods as well as Geth's own management APIs. This too is optional and if you leave it out you can always attach to an already running Geth instance with `geth attach`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Network**\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitioning towards developers, if you'd like to play around with creating Ethereum contracts, you almost certainly would like to do that without any real money involved until you get the hang of the entire system. In other words, instead of attaching to the main network, you want to join the test network with your node, which is fully equivalent to the main network, but with play-Ether only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geth can connect to two different test networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Ropsten*: Best reproduces the current production environment, i.e. system and network conditions on the live Ethereum mainnet, because it's PoW net. Ether can be mined, or requested from a faucet. A downside is that it's not immune to spam attacks (due to PoW).  `geth --testnet` or `geth --networkid 3`\n",
    "- *Rinkeby*: PoA (Proof of Authority) testnet, immune to spam attacks (Ether supply is controlled by trusted parties). The downside is that it doesn't fully reproduce the current production environment as it uses PoA. Ether has to be requested from a faucet. `geth --rinkeby` or `geth --networkid 4`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Private network**\n",
    "\n",
    "An even more convenient way to test and play around with smart contracts is to use a private network. Indeed you can avoid downloading the entire chains of test networks (in the order of GB of size), and spin up a network in a matter of seconds. Setting up the first configuration of a private network can be a little bit more complicated than connecting to an existing one, though.\n",

    "**Light node**\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "Light nodes do not verify every block or transaction and may not have a copy of the current blockchain state. They rely on full nodes to provide them with missing details (or simply lack particular functionality). The advantage of light nodes is that they can get up and running much more quickly, can run on more computationally/memory constrained devices, and don’t eat up nearly as much storage. On the downside, there is an element of trust in other nodes (it varies based on client and probabilistic methods/heuristics can be used to reduce risk).\n",

You can use the `--networkid` command line option for this. The main network has id 1 (the default). So if you supply your own custom network ID which is different than the main network your nodes will not connect to other nodes and form a private network."
